**Natural Language Processing Sentiment Analysis of Immigration Tweets**

A project for Le Wagon Batch #900 by Jenna Tan, Ewan Evans, Humberto Vega Mendez and Ellis Latham.

We scraped and pre-processed 1.3 million unique tweets, used Top2Vec to identify themes and RoBERTa to identify sentiment and emotion.

The project is showcased at https://share.streamlit.io/jennajt/nlp_sentiment/app.py

We used https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion to analyse sentiment and emotion.
